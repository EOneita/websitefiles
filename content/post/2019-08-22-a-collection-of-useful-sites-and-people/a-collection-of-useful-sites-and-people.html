<h2>Getting started with R</h2>
<p>I recently discovered this adorable giraffe themed <a href="https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics">R course</a> 🦒, which I would recommend any new user to R start off with. It’s an aesthetically pleasing primer and best of all, it’s free!</p>
</div>
<div id="people" class="section level2">
<h2>People</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/djnavarro">Danielle Navarro</a></strong> is an #rstats guru who is also very humble, funny, and helpful. She blogs about her experiences (and often frustrations!) with R, which shows that learning R is a constant process. Plus, she has been updating her very popular book <strong><a href="https://learningstatisticswithr.com/">Learning Statistics with R</a></strong>, which has been invaluable for R users everywhere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Maëlle Salmon</strong> has an extensive <a href="https://masalmon.eu/">blog</a> where she provides helpful tips and tricks and posts about interesting projects she is doing. Like Danielle, she is really active on <a href="https://twitter.com/ma_salmon">Twitter</a>.
 </p>
<p><strong>Mara Averick</strong> is another great person to follow on <a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme">Twitter</a>. She is renowned for posting tips and tricks to help with using R (and she uses A LOT of emojis 🥑💃💁‍♀️). <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
 </p>
<p>And of course, <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham"><strong>Hadley Wickham</strong></a> is the man behind much of R’s syntax, including the cornerstone of data visualization, <code>ggplot2</code>. His book <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><em>R for Data Science</em></a> is a staple of R learning. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>

<div id="how-do-i" class="section level2">
<h2>“How do I…?”</h2>
<p><a href="https://smach.github.io/R4JournalismBook/HowDoI.html">Do <em>anything</em>?</a> This is a pretty random assortment of useful commands. I would recommend trawling through it every so often and noting the commands you think might be useful for you in the future.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://socviz.co/appendix.html#a-little-more-about-r">Read an R Help Page?</a>. This is <strong>essential</strong>.</p>

<div id="asking-for-help" class="section level2">
<h2>Asking for help</h2>
<p>For general questions, start <a href="https://masalmon.eu/2018/07/22/wheretogethelp/">here</a>. Maëlle Salmon’s guide to asking for help in R is a great starting point for figuring out <em>how</em> to ask for help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Those of you who identify as female 👩 can always reach out to <a href="https://rladies.org/">R-Ladies</a> for help and support. R Ladies was founded to provide support and encourage positivity in the R community. They have been a huge success in encouraging R as a language of <strong>diversity</strong> and <strong>inclusivity</strong>, in a world where so many programming languages are dominated by men!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is the go-to site for general questions asked by individuals of all genders 👨👩. But <em>beware</em>: it is notorious for being highly technical and for facilitating bullying. Nonetheless, it is a fantastic resource.

<div id="data-carpentry" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Carpentry</h2>
<p>This <a href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~gersteia/MBIO7040/05-dplyr.html">workshop</a> by <strong>Aleeza Gerstein</strong> on data carpentry with <code>dplyr</code> is a great guide to beginning data carpentry. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
 </p>
</div>
<div id="data-visualization" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ClausWilke"><strong>Claus Wilke</strong></a>’s <a href="https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/"><em>Fundamentals of Data Visualization</em></a> was recently published, and should be essential reading for any R user embarking on data analysis (i.e., everyone!).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Kieran Healy</strong> is another big name in data visualization, and his comprehensive <a href="https://socviz.co/">guide</a> covers EVERYTHING. It’s a little “higher level” compared to Claus’s book, so start with <em>Fundamentals of Data Visualization</em> first.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you’re reading this, you’ll hopefully be familiar with <code>ggplot2</code>. What you may not be as familiar with are the steps it takes to build a truly beautiful and informative ggplot. Luckily, <strong>Cédric Scherer</strong> has a <a href="https://cedricscherer.netlify.com/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/">guide</a>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The BBC have a great <a href="https://github.com/bbc/bbplot">guide</a> to creating BBC publication-worthy visualization with <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A collection of themes that will make your plots look visually appealing can be found <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/08/themes-to-improve-your-ggplot-figures/">here</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="spatial-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Spatial Analysis</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/katiejolly6"><strong>Katie Jolly</strong></a> is a spatial analyst R user, and she has a step by step [guide][(<a href="https://www.katiejolly.io/rladies-spatial/" class="uri">https://www.katiejolly.io/rladies-spatial/</a>) to visualizing quantities in an area. Her website has other spatial data workings, all with code! <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is a really cool <a href="https://cartographicperspectives.org/index.php/journal/article/view/1536/1726">way</a> to visualize cartographic lines, although I’m not sure how useful it is.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To make truly expert quality maps, there is no better resource than <strong>Timo Grossenbacher’s</strong> <a href="https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2019/04/bivariate-maps-with-ggplot2-and-sf/">post</a>. I still haven’t managed to make a map that looks this good in <code>ggplot2</code>, but I’m going to keep trying until I do!</p>

<div id="developing-your-skills" class="section level2">
<h2>Developing your skills</h2>
<p>The R community is constantly growing and evolving 🌻. I used to find it daunting to keep up with everything, but <a href="https://rweekly.org/">R-weekly</a> makes it easy to do just that! I recommend making it part of your Monday housekeeping to check it out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://yihui.name/en/">Yihui Xie</a> 🇨🇳 is a genius and one of the key thinkers behind much of “advanced R”, such as <code>rmarkdown</code> and <code>xaringan</code>. Keep an eye on what he’s up to, because his work is an indicator of the direction R is going in. And read his guides! He is one of the best R gurus for explaining advanced concepts thoroughly and clearly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Emily Riederer</strong> wrote a highly influential blog <a href="https://emilyriederer.netlify.com/post/rmarkdown-driven-development/">post</a> on using R markdown to create a better workflow and reproducible code. This will be a bit advanced for new users, but is also <em>very much</em> worth reading closely as you become more comfortable with R. I wish I had read something like this before I picked up a lot of bad habits!!<br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="package-development" class="section level2">
<h2>Package development</h2>
<p>As you get more comfortable with R and R markdown, it is beneficial to learn, and/or become comfortable with, package development. This ensures <em>reproducibility</em> and can make your life a lot easier if you find yourself writing the same functions (or analyses!) over and over. The premier post that users galore have turned to is <strong>Hilary Parker</strong>’s <a href="https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/">“Writing an R package from scratch”</a>. Also check out <strong>Maëlle Salmon</strong>’s <a href="https://masalmon.eu/2017/12/11/goodrpackages/">post</a>, which contains helpful tips around the development of R packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="reporting-your-results" class="section level2">
<h2>Reporting your results</h2>
<p>Although I think it’s important to know how to report your statistical analyses yourself to ensure that you fully understand what you did, <a href="https://github.com/easystats/report"><code>report</code></a> is a dream come true for explaining your results in a clear and standardized way. Nonetheless, <strong>use this tool <em>only</em> when you are confident in your understanding of the analysis you are doing</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="speaking-of-xaringan" class="section level2">
<h2>Speaking of <code>xaringan</code>…</h2>
<p>Building slides for presentations in R is rewarding and perhaps most importantly, it’s EASY! <strong>Yihui Xie</strong>’s guide to <code>xaringan</code> can be found <a href="https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/">here</a>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><code>xaringan</code> doesn’t come with too many themes out of the box, but <a href="https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanthemer">this</a> R package by <strong>Garrick Aden-Buie</strong> provides some slick options.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also just discovered this great <a href="http://arm.rbind.io/slides/xaringan#1">presentation</a> by <strong>Alison Hill</strong> where she gives tips on creating beautiful slides. I fully recommend working through her presentation.</p>
