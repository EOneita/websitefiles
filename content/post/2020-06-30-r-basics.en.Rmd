My most recent iteration of R teaching slides can be found [here](/jun-learn-R-prez.html). The CSS theme is entirely thanks to Danielle Navarro, who documented her process of making beautiful slides and learning CSS. You can check out her github [here](https://github.com/djnavarro)^[I also recommend checking out her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/djnavarro?s=20), where she documents working through R as well as CSS].
